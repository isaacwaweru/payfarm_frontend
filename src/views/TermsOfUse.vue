                securely identifying you when delivering our Services to you. It

                password secure at all times.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you suspect that your secure access to the Platform has been
                compromised in any way, it is your responsibility to contact us.
                You confirm that you will only use our Platform for the purposes
                set out in these Terms. You confirm that you will not attempt to
                gain unauthorised access to the secure areas of the Website or
                Platform and furthermore you will not attempt to use code or

                periods of maintenance and updating. We have the right not to
                act on your instructions including where we deem that your

              </p>

              <h2>ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING</h2>
              <p>
                Where we discover that the Platform is being used to launder
                money or for any suspicious transactions, we have an obligation
                to report your activities to the relevant authorities without
                recourse to you.
              </p>

              <h2>FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK</h2>
              <p>
                Where a Sponsor contributes in a currency other than the Kes,
                foreign exchange gain or loss and fluctuations in currency rates
                may have an impact on the profit made on such contribution by
                the Sponsor. All profits on contribution shall be converted and
                returned in kes based on the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK)
                official exchange rate. The Sponsor therefore enters into any
                transactions in currencies other than the kes at their sole risk
                and shall bear all responsibilities for any gains or loss as a
                result.
              </p>

              <p>
                Unexpected changes in currency exchange market conditions may
                have an impact on the extent of profit the Sponsor would be
                exposed to such as when there is an upward or downward movement
                in the relevant rates. The Sponsor understands and is able to
                assume the risk of loss associated and agrees to be liable for
                any resulting deficit this might have on contributions made or
                profits earned.
              </p>
